# Personal Portfolio Site Using ReactJS

Wanted to practise the fundamentals of ReactJS, so built a portfolio site for software developers so they can showcase themselves and portfolio of work to relevant persons. You can visit the live site [here](https://thuan-dev-portfolio-v1.netlify.app/.)

### Tech Tools

### Features
- Sections include a navbar, hero, portfolio, references and contact form.
- Each item on menu scrolls to relevant section when clicked.
- Set up media queries so app is responsive for all devices. Included a hamburger menu that pops up to save space for people viewing the app on a mobile device. When hamburger menu is clicked a menu section transitions in and out smoothly for a better UX.
- Light and dark mode toggle for user visual preferences.
- Portfolio section with clickable tags which renders different dummy data depending on what is clicked. I wanted to use tags to give developers flexibility to highlight certain projects with a certain theme.
- References for credibility
- Contact form was built using EmailJS so interested parties could reach out. Once form is submitted it is instantly sent to users designated email where they can reply.
- Each section has a vertical snap scroll for clear and quick transitions to sections
