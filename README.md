## Brief Application Demo

## Project Details

### The Team
This was a solo project.

### Problem
Primarily showcasing body of work as a software developer so that hiring managers can see what I've done thus far. Secondarily I wanted more experience working and implementing React fundamentals.
Lastly I wanted to practise an alternative to plain CSS and so picked SCSS over bootstrap.

### Who Is This For
Hiring managers and recruiters.

### Planning
Spoke with people who have been involved in the hiring process and enquired what they're looking for in terms of portfolios. From there I looked at existing personal portfolios from the industry and outside of the industry to see what I liked and added them to a design collage on Figma. Using the design collage I drafted a low fidelity wireframe to get a quick structure of sections and layout, then moved on to creating high fidelity designs on Figma and using Coolors to craft a custom color palette.

### Tech Tools

| Front-end | Tools        |
| --------- | ------------ |
| React     | Figma        |
| SCSS      | Dribbble     |
| EmailJS   | Font Awesome |
|           | MUI          |


### Features
- Sections include a navbar, hero, portfolio, references and contact form.
- Each item on menu scrolls to relevant section when clicked.
- Set up media queries so app is responsive for all devices. Included a hamburger menu that pops up to save space for people viewing the app on a mobile device. When hamburger menu is clicked a menu section transitions in and out smoothly for a better UX.
- Light and dark mode toggle for user visual preferences.
- Portfolio section with clickable tags which renders different dummy data depending on what is clicked. I wanted to use tags to give developers flexibility to highlight certain projects with a certain theme.
- References for credibility
- Contact form was built using EmailJS so interested parties could reach out. Once form is submitted it is instantly sent to users designated email where they can reply.
- Each section has a vertical snap scroll for clear and quick transitions to sections

### Reflection
- Planning is cheap and coding is expensive

### Future Vision
- Add headless CMS to host more pertinent information of projects, instead of leaving as hard coded dummy data or building out own backend to save more time
- Convert from Javascript to Typescript
